## Biography

He is a researcher and engineer specializing in digital signal and image processing, sensor fusion, and AI-driven medical imaging systems. His research emphasizes transform-domain analysis, stochastic modeling of multiplicative noise in ultrasound imaging, inverse problem formulation for artifact suppression, and optimization-based reconstruction methods. He develops intelligent sensing architectures and embedded edge AI platforms for real-time healthcare signal processing. His long-term objective is to formalize computational sensory substitution as a cross-modal mapping problem, designing mathematically grounded operators that transform stereoscopic visual fields into structured spatial–temporal auditory representations for assistive perception systems.
